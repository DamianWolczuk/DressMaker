  C# CRUD to manage a simple fashion store

My task was to create a local application for managing a tailoring company. My application will offer functions that improve the work of the company owner, to organize the work of employees and to better manage conversations with potential customers. In order to encourage and attract customers, the application will have an intuitive and eye-friendly graphical interface that facilitates working with this application. Thanks to these amenities
